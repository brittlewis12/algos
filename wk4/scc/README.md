Strongly Connected Components of a Graph
===

## The Problem
* given a directed graph (a collection of vertices connected by edges, traversable only in one direction), determine the groupings of vertices such that each vertex is reachable from every other.

## Test Input
* a large file of integers [that represent a graph](http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/algo1/programming_prob/SCC.txt)
* each row makes up an edge in that graph, with tail and head space-separated

## Source
* Week 4 homework of Stanford's Algorithm Design and Analysis course on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/algo-007/).
