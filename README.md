Stanford's Algorithm Design & Analysis
===

This is my repo where I implement various problems and algorithms that I encounter throughout Tim Roughgarden's algorithms course on [coursera](https://class.coursera.org/algo-007/)

## Weekly Problems
* week 1: counting array inversions (merge sort)
* week 2: counting comparisons in quick sort
* week 3: finding the min cut of an undirected graph
