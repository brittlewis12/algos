Minimum Cut Problem -- Randomized Contraction
===

## The Problem
* given an undirected graph (vertices and edges), find the cut (partition of the graph into two non-empty parts) with the fewest edges crossing between the two sides

## Test Input
* a file of with [200 rows of space-separated integers](http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/algo1/programming_prob/kargerMinCut.txt)
* each row's first integer represents a vertex in a graph
* the rest of the row enumerates all its adjacent vertices (its shared edges)
