Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm
===

## The Problem
* find the shortest path for a given starting vertex in a connected graph to each other reachable vertex.

## Test Input
* a file of [all integers from 1..10,000](http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/algo1/programming_prob/dijkstraData.txt)
* each row's first integer represents a vertex in a graph
* the rest of the row is comma-separated tuples, which represent all its adjacent vertices (its shared edges) and their weights
